# Guide

Kipa is an IPA converter designed to be used with the US-Standard keyboard layout. 
All diacritics (and special characters) are composed with a base letter and multiple pairs of modifier symbols. For example:

- [e.:] => [eː]. The ː is composed of two symbols: the category (".", suprasegmentals, and ":" which under the suprasegmentals category means "ː".

- [e;^] => [ə]. The ";" category is special; it converts base characters. In this case, [e] can be converted to [ə] using the modifier category with "^", the symbol generally used for rotation.
